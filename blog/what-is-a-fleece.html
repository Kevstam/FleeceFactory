                <p>If you've spent any time in dynasty fantasy football circles, you've probably heard someone say "that was a total fleece!" But what exactly does getting fleeced mean, and how can you avoid becoming the victim of a lopsided trade?</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">What Does "Fleece" Mean?</h2>
                
                <p>In fantasy football, a <strong>fleece</strong> is a trade where one team gets significantly more value than the other. It's a one-sided deal where someone gets robbed, similar to being "fleeced" of their wool. The team that gets fleeced gives up far more than they receive in return.</p>

                <p>Unlike close trades where reasonable people might disagree about the winner, a fleece is obvious to most experienced dynasty managers. It's the kind of trade that makes the rest of your league wonder if collusion is involved.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Classic Examples of Fleeces</h2>

                <p><strong>Example 1: The Superstar Swindle</strong><br>
                Team A receives: Justin Jefferson<br>
                Team B receives: DJ Moore + a 2nd round pick<br>
                <br>
                This is a fleece. Justin Jefferson is a top-5 dynasty asset. While DJ Moore is a solid WR2, the value gap is enormous. Team B got absolutely robbed.</p>

                <p><strong>Example 2: The Rookie Pick Robbery</strong><br>
                Team A receives: 1.01 pick + Breece Hall<br>
                Team B receives: Travis Etienne + 2.05 pick<br>
                <br>
                Team A is getting a potential generational RB prospect plus an elite young back. Team B is getting a tier-2 RB and a late second. Complete fleece.</p>

                <p><strong>Example 3: The Name Value Trap</strong><br>
                Team A receives: Chris Godwin (age 29)<br>
                Team B receives: Garrett Wilson (age 23)<br>
                <br>
                In dynasty, youth is king. Trading a 23-year-old ascending star for an aging veteran is dynasty suicide. Team B got fleeced based on name recognition alone.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Warning Signs You're About to Get Fleeced</h2>

                <p>ðŸš© <strong>They're rushing you</strong> - "This offer expires in 10 minutes!" is a classic fleece tactic.<br>
                ðŸš© <strong>They're overvaluing age</strong> - Trying to convince you a 30-year-old RB is worth a 22-year-old WR.<br>
                ðŸš© <strong>Quantity over quality</strong> - Offering you 3-4 mediocre players for your stud.<br>
                ðŸš© <strong>Buying high on hype</strong> - Capitalizing on one good week to steal your proven asset.<br>
                ðŸš© <strong>They won't negotiate</strong> - "Take it or leave it" usually means they know they're ripping you off.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">How to Avoid Getting Fleeced</h2>

                <p>The best defense against getting fleeced is education and patience. Always:</p>

                <p>âœ… Use trade calculators and value charts<br>
                âœ… Get second opinions from league mates or online communities<br>
                âœ… Sleep on big trades before accepting<br>
                âœ… Understand dynasty values vs redraft values<br>
                âœ… Never trade when emotional (after a bad loss)</p>
