                <p>One of the biggest mistakes dynasty managers make is not understanding player values before entering trade negotiations. You might think your aging running back is worth a first-round pick, but the rest of the league sees him as a mid-season rental at best.</p>

                <p>This guide breaks down dynasty trade values by position, helping you understand what players are actually worth in 2025 dynasty leagues. These values reflect superflex PPR scoring, which is the most common dynasty format.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Understanding Dynasty Value</h2>
                
                <p>Dynasty value is different from redraft value. In dynasty, you're not just evaluating this season‚Äîyou're projecting 3-5 years into the future. A 24-year-old breakout receiver is worth more than a 29-year-old veteran putting up similar numbers because of their age and upside.</p>

                <p><strong>Key factors that determine dynasty value:</strong></p>

                <p>üìä <strong>Age</strong> - Youth is king in dynasty. Players under 25 get a premium.<br>
                üìà <strong>Upside</strong> - Potential matters more than current production for young players.<br>
                üèÜ <strong>Situation</strong> - Contract status, team quality, and offensive system.<br>
                üí™ <strong>Positional scarcity</strong> - Elite QBs and young RBs command the highest prices.<br>
                üìâ <strong>Injury history</strong> - Durability concerns tank value quickly.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Tier 1: Elite Dynasty Assets</h2>

                <div class="player-tier">
                    <p class="font-bold text-white mb-2">Worth: 3+ first-round picks</p>
                    <p><strong>Quarterbacks:</strong> Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Jalen Hurts, CJ Stroud<br>
                    <strong>Running Backs:</strong> Bijan Robinson, Breece Hall, Jahmyr Gibbs<br>
                    <strong>Wide Receivers:</strong> Justin Jefferson, Ja'Marr Chase, CeeDee Lamb, Amon-Ra St. Brown<br>
                    <strong>Tight Ends:</strong> Sam LaPorta, Brock Bowers</p>
                </div>

                <p>These are your league-winners. If you own any of these players, don't trade them unless you're getting a massive overpay. They're young, elite producers who will anchor your team for years.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Tier 2: Premium Assets</h2>

                <div class="player-tier">
                    <p class="font-bold text-white mb-2">Worth: 2 first-round picks or 1 first + quality starter</p>
                    <p><strong>Quarterbacks:</strong> Anthony Richardson, Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels, Trevor Lawrence<br>
                    <strong>Running Backs:</strong> Kenneth Walker, De'Von Achane, Kyren Williams<br>
                    <strong>Wide Receivers:</strong> Garrett Wilson, Drake London, Chris Olave, Puka Nacua, Marvin Harrison Jr<br>
                    <strong>Tight Ends:</strong> Trey McBride, Dalton Kincaid</p>
                </div>

                <p>Premium assets are young players with either proven production or elite upside. They're building blocks for championship teams but haven't quite reached the untouchable tier yet.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Tier 3: Solid Starters</h2>

                <div class="player-tier">
                    <p class="font-bold text-white mb-2">Worth: 1 first-round pick or 2 second-round picks</p>
                    <p><strong>Quarterbacks:</strong> Tua Tagovailoa, Dak Prescott, Brock Purdy, Jordan Love<br>
                    <strong>Running Backs:</strong> Rachaad White, Travis Etienne, James Cook, Rhamondre Stevenson<br>
                    <strong>Wide Receivers:</strong> DK Metcalf, Deebo Samuel, Tee Higgins, Jameson Williams, Zay Flowers<br>
                    <strong>Tight Ends:</strong> Kyle Pitts, David Njoku, Jake Ferguson</p>
                </div>

                <p>These are your reliable weekly starters. They're worth holding unless you're rebuilding or getting good value in return. Be careful not to overvalue aging players in this tier.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Tier 4: Flex/Depth Players</h2>

                <div class="player-tier">
                    <p class="font-bold text-white mb-2">Worth: Late first or early-to-mid second-round pick</p>
                    <p><strong>Running Backs:</strong> Najee Harris, Tony Pollard, Javonte Williams<br>
                    <strong>Wide Receivers:</strong> Jordan Addison, Christian Watson, Rashee Rice, Jaxon Smith-Njigba<br>
                    <strong>Tight Ends:</strong> Evan Engram, Pat Freiermuth</p>
                </div>

                <p>Flex players are valuable as depth pieces but shouldn't be the centerpiece of your trade. These are the types of players you package to move up a tier.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">The Age Cliff: When to Sell</h2>

                <p>Understanding when player values drop is crucial for maximizing trade returns. Here are the key age thresholds:</p>

                <p><strong>Running Backs:</strong> Sell before age 27. Very few RBs maintain elite value past 28.<br>
                <strong>Wide Receivers:</strong> Peak years are 24-29. Start considering selling around age 30.<br>
                <strong>Quarterbacks:</strong> Long shelf life. Can be elite into their mid-30s in dynasty.<br>
                <strong>Tight Ends:</strong> Later bloomers. Often peak at 25-28 and maintain value longer.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Draft Pick Values</h2>

                <p>Understanding pick values helps you evaluate trades involving draft capital:</p>

                <p><strong>1.01-1.03 (Early firsts):</strong> Worth a borderline Tier 2 player<br>
                <strong>1.04-1.06 (Mid firsts):</strong> Worth a Tier 3 player or two Tier 4 players<br>
                <strong>1.07-1.12 (Late firsts):</strong> Worth a young Tier 3 player or depth piece<br>
                <strong>Early seconds:</strong> Worth a Tier 4 player or high-upside lottery ticket<br>
                <strong>Late seconds/thirds:</strong> Dart throws, minimal trade value</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Common Trade Value Mistakes</h2>

                <p><strong>Mistake 1: Overvaluing your own players</strong><br>
                We all think our players are worth more than they are. Get objective opinions before setting asking prices.</p>

                <p><strong>Mistake 2: Ignoring age in dynasty</strong><br>
                A 29-year-old WR1 is not equal to a 24-year-old WR1, even with similar stats. The younger player is worth significantly more.</p>

                <p><strong>Mistake 3: Chasing last year's breakout</strong><br>
                Don't overpay for players coming off career years. Regression is real.</p>

                <p><strong>Mistake 4: Undervaluing draft picks</strong><br>
                First-round picks are valuable, especially early ones. Don't give them away for aging veterans.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Using Trade Values in Negotiations</h2>

                <p>When evaluating trades, add up the tier values on both sides. If one side is clearly getting more value (a full tier difference or more), that's probably a fleece.</p>

                <p>Remember: these values are guidelines, not absolutes. League settings, roster construction, and team strategy all matter. A contender might pay a premium for an aging stud, while a rebuilder should prioritize youth and picks.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white">Check Your Trade Value</h2>

                <p>Before accepting any trade, run it through our trade analyzer to see if you're getting fair value. Don't let someone fleece you out of your dynasty future.</p>
